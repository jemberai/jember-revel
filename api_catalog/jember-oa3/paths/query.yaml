  summary: Query documents
  description: |
    Query documents in the data intake vector store. Provide the query string, and specify the number of documents
    to return in the search response. The top-K most similar documents to the query will be returned.
    The value of K must be greater than 0. Optionally, provide a similarity threshold score to filter the search
    response by. Only documents with similarity score equal or greater than the 'threshold' will be returned.
    Note that this is a post-processing step performed on the client not the server side. A threshold value
    of 0.0 means any similarity is accepted or disable the similarity threshold filtering. A threshold value 
    of 1.0 means an exact match is required.
