      Number of documents to return in the search response. The top-K most similar documents
      to the query will be returned. The value of K must be greater than 0.
  similarityThreshold:
    type: number
    format: float
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 1
    default: 0.0
    description: |
      Similarity threshold score to filter the search response by. Only documents with similarity
      score equal or greater than the 'threshold' will be returned. Note that this is a post-processing
      step performed on the client not the server side. A threshold value of 0.0 means any similarity
      is accepted or disable the similarity threshold filtering. A threshold value of 1.0 means an exact
      match is required.
